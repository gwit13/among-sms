# Among SMS
A2P location sharing Android application for HackTJ 8.0.

## Rationale
Location sharing is an incredibly useful product of the digital age. Wheter meeting up with friends, staying safe after dark, or thousands of other uses, it has changed the way we plan our lives and use the technology around us. However, there are some people that don't trust the main players like Facebook, Apple, and Google with their location data, and that's perfectly valid. Location is a highly sensitive and personal piece of information to give to an enourmous company.  
## Overview
Among SMS is a proof-of-concept location sharing service that works entirely independent of the internet. By creating an SMS receiver app that will read texts from a specified friend's phone number __*without looking at previous chat history or messages into the future*__, location data can be sent and received securely, entirely independent of the internet
